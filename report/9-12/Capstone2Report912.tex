\noindent Report for Sept. 12

Our project intends to first solve the Graph Isomorphism Problem and then use GPU programming to parallelize the solution for a significant performance improvement. The project's progress should proceed as follows. Each week will be accompanied with a report detailing the actual progress.

\begin{itemize}
  \item September 12th --- This report, along with the data set that will be used to test our solution, both for correctness and for performance benchmarks.
  \item September 19th --- Report on plans to implement our solution, as well as progress on development of the solution itself.
  \item September 26th --- Completion of program to match % MAAAAAX
    % maybe completion of CPU implementation?
  \item October 3rd --- % MAAAAAX
  \item October 10th --- Verification that solution works on data set provided, begin planning GPU implementation.
    % these next two are a crapshoot
  \item October 17th --- Begin work on GPU implementation, with focus on optimizing speed of mapping nodes from one graph to another.
  \item October 24th --- Continue working on GPU implementation, shifting focus to comparing connections between nodes and checking for isomorphism.
  \item October 31st --- Report on bugs identified and plans to fix them.
  \item November 7th --- Completion of GPU implementation. 
  \item November 14th --- Designing of GUI/front end.
  \item November 21st --- Continuing work on front end.
  \item November 28th --- Connection of front end to back end.
  \item December 5th --- Completion of project, final testing.
  \item December 12th --- Completion of final report.
\end{itemize}
